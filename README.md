Spike for a project with layered architecture.
<br/>

In one had there the backend exposed through rest services.
The backend its implemented with SpringBoot
<br/>

In the other hand is the frontend wich in this case
its being implemenented with ReactJS, but could be any
view technology.
<br/>

You can start the view with the "npm start" command.
<br/>

A spike should produce information instead of working code.
